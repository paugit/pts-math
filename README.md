# pts-math - pmjo's TypeScript Math library

An easy to use TypeScript library for basic vector and matrix calculations and for orthogonal and perspective projections. Designed to be fast but still convenient to use. Unnecessary conditionals (safety checks), loops and function calls are avoided so know what you are doing, e.g. donâ€™t use source as a destination. Matrix2x2 and Matrix3x3 are still stubs and other classes have only the things I have needed so far. Partially untested.
